  title: Update the response format when detailed error information is disabled
  area: REST API
  details: |
    Previously, if `http.detailed_errors.enabled` was set to `false`, error responses would
    lack `type` and `reason` fields. Now, errors will always have these fields,
    regardless of the `detailed_errors` setting.
  impact: |
    If using `http.detailed_errors.enabled: false`, ensure that anything
    interacting with the REST API will be able to handle the added presence of
    `type` and `reason` fields for errors.
  notable: false
