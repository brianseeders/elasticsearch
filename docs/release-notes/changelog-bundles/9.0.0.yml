    summary: Upgrade `discovery-ec2` to AWS SDK v2
    area: Discovery-Plugins

      area: Cluster and node setting
      title: Upgrade `discovery-ec2` to AWS SDK v2
      details: |2-

        In earlier versions of {es} the `discovery-ec2` plugin was based on the AWS SDK v1. AWS will withdraw support for this SDK before the end of the life of {es} {minor-version} so we must migrate to the newer AWS SDK v2.
        Unfortunately there are several differences between the two AWS SDK versions which may require you to adjust your system configuration when upgrading to {es} {minor-version} or later. These differences include, but may not be limited to, the following items.
        * AWS SDK v2 does not support the EC2 IMDSv1 protocol.
        * AWS SDK v2 does not support the `aws.secretKey` or
          `com.amazonaws.sdk.ec2MetadataServiceEndpointOverride` system properties.

        * AWS SDK v2 does not permit specifying a choice between HTTP and HTTPS so
          the `discovery.ec2.protocol` setting is no longer effective.

        * AWS SDK v2 does not accept an access key without a secret key or vice
          versa.
      impact: |2-

        If you use the `discovery-ec2` plugin, test your upgrade thoroughly before upgrading any production workloads.
        Adapt your configuration to the new SDK functionality. This includes, but may not be limited to, the following items.
        * If you use IMDS to determine the availability zone of a node or to obtain
          credentials for accessing the EC2 API, ensure that it supports the IMDSv2
          protocol.

        * If applicable, discontinue use of the `aws.secretKey` and
          `com.amazonaws.sdk.ec2MetadataServiceEndpointOverride` system properties.

        * If applicable, specify that you wish to use the insecure HTTP protocol to
          access the EC2 API by setting `discovery.ec2.endpoint` to a URL which
          starts with `http://`.

        * Either supply both an access key and a secret key using the keystore
          settings `discovery.ec2.access_key` and `discovery.ec2.secret_key`, or
          configure neither of these settings.
